My user story 
I have followed the instruction that provide a code base that require an accessibility standard of the websites called "Horiseon"
I did review the source code
re-arrange the Semantic in HTML element and re-structure the element.
I also added an "alt" into an icon and image source element in HTML. 
so, you view my HTML will be in subsequential order and neat.
